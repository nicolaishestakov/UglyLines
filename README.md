# UglyLines

This project is intended to demonstrate code smells, antipatterns and design issues commonly found in code. It is the part of my course 'Software architecture' in Tomsk State University. Often when teaching programming design principles, the examples are not persuasive because they are too small. Here I plan to:
1. Demonstrate code issues by bugfixing and implementing new features. As the code is bad, this will be difficult and painful.
2. Then I will apply some design principles, refactor the code and show how maintainability would improve.
3. Show how the refactored code would be testable as well

You may observe this process throughout commit history. It will not necessarily be a perfect app in the end, some design issues will probably stay.
You may look at the previous project with the same purpose: https://github.com/nicolaishestakov/UglyTetris
